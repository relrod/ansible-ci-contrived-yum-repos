This repository contains rpms for testing how the yum/dnf modules handle:
* multiple arches of the same package
* virtual packages

Install pkgs:
  - rpmdevtools
  - createrepo

Then build everything with:
./build-rpms.sh

It should work on any RHEL-ish container.

When successful, upload the entire directory tree to S3.
